om3 controller is coded in .net 2.0 using c# as main language, but vb is also fine for additional plugins. Even though the om3 controller comes with its own windows UI, it is also possible to just use the library for your own .net projects. Has a very simple and straight forward API and all keys can be directly programmed, using plugin functionality is optional.
